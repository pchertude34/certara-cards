## How to Run Locally

This app uses NPM for dependency management. Before starting, make sure you have NPM installed.

1. Clone or Fork the application from GitHub
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. The application should be available at http://localhost:5173 by default. However, check the console to get the exact port since it could be different if the default port is occupied.
